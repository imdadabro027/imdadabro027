## üíª Projects

Here are some of my recent projects:

- TMA Message Center App([link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TMA.MessageCenter) is a cutting-edge mobile application developed using React Native, incorporating WebView technology. As an Android application, it offers users a seamless and immersive experience within the TMA ecosystem. Through the integration of WebView, the app enables users to access and interact with the TMA platform directly from their Android devices. With a user-friendly interface, TMA Message Center allows users to exchange messages, share files, and collaborate efficiently, all within a secure and optimized WebView environment. This achievement demonstrates my expertise in leveraging React Native and WebView to create a powerful and feature-rich app that enhances communication and productivity within the TMA community.
- Ecomern MERN Website([link](https://github.com/Zayn365/Final-Project-frontend)) is an innovative and dynamic web application that I have developed. Leveraging the power of the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, along with React Redux for state management, React Bootstrap for responsive design, Stripe integration for secure payments, and the Cloudinary widget for seamless image uploading, Ecomern offers a comprehensive e-commerce experience. With a user-friendly interface, reliable data storage, secure transactions, and efficient image management, Ecomern exemplifies my expertise in creating cutting-edge web applications that deliver exceptional performance and user satisfaction.
- IoslPakistan([link](ioslkarachi.com)): "IoslPakistan" is a responsive landing page website created by me for a client. This project showcases my skills in using React, React-Router, Bootstrap, and SwiperJS to develop high-quality web applications. The website is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, providing users with a seamless browsing experience. With its responsive design, the website looks great on any device, from desktops to smartphones. This project was a fun and engaging experience for me, allowing me to showcase my creativity and technical skills while delivering a high-quality product to my client.
- Yahtzee-Game([link](https://github.com/Zayn365/Yahtzee-Game-React)): "Yahtzee-Game" is a personal passion project that showcases the power and flexibility of React-JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The game is based on the classic dice game called "Yahtzee", where the objective is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. While the basic coding of the game may seem simple, the implementation of complex game functionalities such as keeping track of scores, calculating bonuses and providing interactive user feedback was challenging. Through this project, I was able to enhance my coding skills and gain a deeper understanding of React-JS. Overall, Yahtzee-Game is a fun and engaging way to pass the time while also demonstrating the potential of React-JS in game development.
- Lights-Out-Game-React([link](https://github.com/Zayn365/Lights-Out-Game-React)): "Lights-Out-Game-React" is a web application built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The game is based on the classic puzzle game called "Lights Out", where the objective is to turn off all the lights on a board by toggling them on and off. The game features a simple and intuitive interface, and players can choose between different board sizes and difficulty levels. This project is a great example of how React can be used to create interactive and engaging web applications.
